# Snake-Game
Snake Game is just my personal project for learning and exploring javascript<br><br>

<b>#How to play :</b> <br>
Enter your player name.<br>
Select appropriate control sheme.<br>
hit the play button.<br>

<b>#Aim of player :</b> <br> 
kill others snakes and eat there remains to grow.

<b>#Rules :</b><br>
  if a snake bites other snake's tail then the snake who bit will die.<br>
  if a snake hit the boundries of the world they will die.<br><br>


There isn't really much to say about the game.. haven't really added much.
for keeping the performance optimal we can't really afford to add alot of 
activits or complex calculations. so for now the project is abandoned but
i might come back to it some day if got some idea or anything.<br><br>

feel free to fork or send a pull request.
